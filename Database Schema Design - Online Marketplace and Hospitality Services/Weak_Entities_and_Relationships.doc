Assumptions:
• A renter may make at most one comment for the rent he/she paid for.
• A property owner may make at most one comment for the user who paid the rent.
Explanations:
• Entity “Users” is used to represent a user in the system, including both property owners and
renters.
• Since a user may re-post a post many times, relationship between Posts – PostPayments is 1-N,
relationship between Users – PostPayments is 1-N.
• Comments may be included as attributes of Rents (hence, there is no need for Comments and
PropertyComments entities). That is acceptable.
• Attribute Status on entity Post may be redundant (the post is active or inactive can be known from
the Expiry date).

• Weak entities:
o PropertyItems: A property must be created by a user. A property item cannot exist in the
system without its owner.
o Post: A post must relate to an owner and a specific property.
o PropertyComments/RentComments: Comments cannot exist without the user who made
it or the entity (Property / Rent) it targets to.
o Payment methods: A payment method is for a specific user and hence, depends on the
user.

• Weak relationships: One may exist independently with the other.
o Property Options – PropertyItems:
o Size – PropertyItems
o PayForPost – Users
o Rent – Users
o PaymentMethods - PayForPost
o PaymentMethods – Rent
